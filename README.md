# Numerical-Method

**Numerical-Method:** Numerical methods, is approximation fast solution for mathematical problems. Such problems can be in any field in engineering. So any result you get from it is approximated not exact, it give you the solution faster than normal ones, also itâ€™s easy to be programmed.

**Least-Squares-Method:** The method of least squares is a standard approach in regression analysis to approximate the solution of overdetermined systems by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals made in the results of every single equation. The most important application is in data fitting.

Following curve is used for data fitting:
1. Straight Line (y=mx+c)
2. Second Degree Parabola (y=ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c or y=a+bx+cx<sup>2</sup>)
3. Exponential Equation (y=ae<sup>bx</sup>)
4. Curve y=ab<sup>x</sup> and
5. Another curve y=ax<sup>b</sup>
